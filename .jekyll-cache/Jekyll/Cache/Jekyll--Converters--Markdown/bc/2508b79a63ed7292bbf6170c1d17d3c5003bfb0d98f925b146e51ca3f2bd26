I"<p>I’m Nikola Stojaković, a software developer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad">Novi Sad, Serbia</a>. I was around 6 when father bought a PC for me and my step sister. As soon as I took a mouse in my hand and saw cursor moving on the screen I became fascinated with computers. I discovered programming when I was 12 with C++ and I instantly realized what I would like to do when I grow up.</p>

<p>When I was 16 I met Antonio, a guy from my secondary school. Along with him I started working on some interesting projects and earned my first money by writing code. I also attended few hackathons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hacking Politics Hackathon in Belgrade (2016)</li>
  <li>Coder Dojo Hackathon in Pančevo (2017)</li>
  <li>OrganiCity Hackathon in Novi Sad (2018)</li>
  <li>Metropolitan University Hackathon in Niš (2018)
 </li>
</ul>

<p>These days I mostly write TypeScript and use Node.js, React, Svelte but I also do a bit of Java and Spring. In my spare time I enjoy dabbling in C++ and exchanging ideas on how to become a better software developer and a better human being with people on the Internet. I also love to read, mostly about psychology, philosophy, computer science and politics.</p>

<p>Currently I work at <a href="https://inviggo.com">Inviggo</a>.</p>
