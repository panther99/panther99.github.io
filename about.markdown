I'm Nikola Stojaković, a software developer from [Novi Sad, Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad). I was around 6 when father bought a PC for me and my step sister. As soon as I took a mouse in my hand and saw cursor moving on the screen I became fascinated with computers. I discovered programming when I was 12 with C++ and I instantly realized what I would like to do when I grow up.

When I was 16 I met Antonio, a guy from my secondary school. Along with him I started working on some interesting projects and earned my first money by writing code. I also attended few hackathons:

* Hacking Politics Hackathon in Belgrade (2016)
* Coder Dojo Hackathon in Pančevo (2017)
* OrganiCity Hackathon in Novi Sad (2018)
* Metropolitan University Hackathon in Niš (2018)

These days I mostly write TypeScript and use Node.js, React and Svelte but I also do a bit of Java and .NET. In my spare time, beside working on my side projects, I enjoy training, playing games, learning new languages and reading - mostly about psychology, philosophy, computer science and politics.

Currently I work at [Inviggo](https://inviggo.com).

## 🌍 Traveling

I'm an avid traveler. I enjoy learning about different cultures, trying exotic food and dabbling in new languages. Here is the list of countries I've visited so far (I'm not counting [ex-YU countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia#Legacy)*):

### Europe

* 🇭🇺 Hungary (2017)
* 🇦🇹 Austria (2017)
* 🇨🇿 Czechia (2017)
* 🇸🇰 Slovakia (2017)
* 🇹🇷 Turkey (2021)
* 🇸🇪 Sweden (2022)

### Asia

* 🇹🇭 Thailand (2022)

<small>* ex-YU countries share much of the cultural heritage and have pretty much the same language (with some slight differences) so I don't feel like I'm even leaving the country</small>
